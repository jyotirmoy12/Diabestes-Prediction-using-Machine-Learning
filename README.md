# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health parameters. The model uses machine learning algorithms to predict the outcome, enabling early detection and proactive healthcare management.


## Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic medical condition where the body cannot properly process food for use as energy. Early detection of diabetes is essential to prevent complications and improve patient outcomes. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the presence of diabetes based on patient data, such as age, BMI, glucose levels, etc.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which includes information on 768 women and various health attributes like:
- Age
- Number of pregnancies
- Plasma glucose concentration
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin level
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age

The target variable is whether the person has diabetes (1) or not (0).

## Model

For this project, several machine learning algorithms are applied, including:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Neural Networks**

Each algorithm is trained on the dataset to predict the presence or absence of diabetes, and their performances are compared.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jyotirmoy12/Diabestes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning.git
    cd Diabestes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
    ```
